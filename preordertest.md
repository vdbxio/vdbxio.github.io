Aura by Voidbox Industries is a Qi compatible wireless charging pad made from concrete, hardwood veneer, and neoprene. Concrete creates a unique finish with each pour. The laser etched hardwood top creates a scratch free surface for your phone to sit on and the neoprene base provides a slightly tacky cusion to keep itself from sliding all over your desk.

Its design files will become open source once it begins shipping. Keep an eye on our Instagram and Facebook page for updates.
