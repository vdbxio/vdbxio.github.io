The USB-BD by Voidbox Industries is a unique power solution for breadboard prototyping & other electronics projects. It provides 5V power from Micro-USB, features a switch for easy disconnections, and includes a JST 2.0 header & lead for the data terminals. Additionally there are two solder jumpers: one for bypassing the switch and one to ground the ID pin for OTG connections. The Micro-USB port is soldered by us in California from imported components using a lead-free process. Included in the pack is 5x USB-BD PCBs with Micro USB, 5x of 5.8mm Micro Latching Switch, 5x JST 2.0 Header, 5x JST 2.0 Lead, and 10x 1x2 pin headers for you to solder yourself.

Our fearless leader, Chloe Madison has designed a beautiful concrete business card holder with a powerful neodymium magnet and steel ball. The ball and magnet keep several business cards in place, yet allow for cards to be pulled out one at a time. The source material is the original 3D Model of the design which was 3D Printed and molded for concrete forming.

A future product of ours is a Bluetooth headset and the CSR8635 modules are inexpensive and easily available online. Problem is that the pins are extremely small and a breakout board is required for prototyping. We have our extras that we had made in our Tindie shop, but feel free to make one yourself if you have the means. Designed in EasyEDA.
