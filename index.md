A USB header for PC motherboards designed to be as minimal as possible. It may interfere with components on some motherboards. Its intended use is for keeping small flash-drives, wireless controllers, or USB license keys inside a computer enclosure.

It can also be a powerful tool for computer techs who can keep two USB tools together such as a diagnostics OS on flash drive alongside a wireless keyboard/mouse receiver.

My personal use case is in a custom built super slim NAS enclosure that runs UnRAID. My OS is on a tiny flash drive and the second slot holds a 2.4ghz receiver for a thumb keyboard/trackpad thing. All current offerings I could find were too tall for my needs or were a wired assembly, this is much cleaner.

The USB-BD by Voidbox Industries is a unique power solution for breadboard prototyping & other electronics projects. It provides 5V power from Micro-USB, features a switch for easy disconnections, and includes a JST 2.0 header & lead for the data terminals. Additionally there are two solder jumpers: one for bypassing the switch and one to ground the ID pin for OTG connections. The Micro-USB port is soldered by us in California from imported components using a lead-free process. Included in the pack is 5x USB-BD PCBs with Micro USB, 5x of 5.8mm Micro Latching Switch, 5x JST 2.0 Header, 5x JST 2.0 Lead, and 10x 1x2 pin headers for you to solder yourself.

A future product of ours is a Bluetooth headset and the CSR8635 modules are inexpensive and easily available online. Problem is that the pins are extremely small and a breakout board is required for prototyping. We have our extras that we had made in our Tindie shop, but feel free to make one yourself if you have the means. Designed in EasyEDA.
