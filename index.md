Our fearless leader, Chloe Madison has designed a beautiful concrete business card holder with a powerful neodymium magnet and steel ball. The ball and magnet keep several business cards in place, yet allow for cards to be pulled out one at a time. The source material is the original 3D Model of the design which was 3D Printed and molded for concrete forming.

A future product of ours is a Bluetooth headset and the CSR8635 modules are inexpensive and easily available online. Problem is that the pins are extremely small and a breakout board is required for prototyping. We have our extras that we had made in our Tindie shop, but feel free to make one yourself if you have the means. Designed in EasyEDA.
