The ball and magnet keep several business cards in place, yet allow for cards to be pulled out one at a time.

A future product of ours is a Bluetooth headset and the CSR8635 modules are inexpensive and easily available online. Problem is that the pins are extremely small and a breakout board is required for prototyping. We have our extras that we had made in our Tindie shop, but feel free to make one yourself if you have the means. Designed in EasyEDA.
