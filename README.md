# VDBX.io Starter Site

We decided we wanted something simple and easy to update as a website while we build out our actual website. The plan is currently to build the final site that we hope will last us several years on either Magento 2 or Concrete5. We will be adding product links to this page as a repository so that everyone can find the source code for our projects in one place. 

To add an item, edit index.md and duplicate the Markdown for the most recent entry. Then you can add the proper information to the new listing block.

Current required items
- Image: please upload image to the `/img` folder and copy its url
- Title
- Description - No longer than a paragraph or two
- Link to Buy - Amazon, Tindie, Etsy (prefer Amazon)
- Link to Source - This can be another Github repo, a Fusion360 link, Thingiverse Listing, EasyEDA Project Page, etc. -- It should be noted that most project/products should have their own GitHub repo and that should be prioritized especially if a project/product has source information in more than one location.
  - 'Source Coming Soon' - Use this only in certain situations eg. product/project is still WIP or docs are just around the corner - do not leave like this for more than 30 days.
